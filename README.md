This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to the unexpected behavior of the `calc()` function when combining percentages with other units.  The example highlights a situation where the calculated value differs from the expected result, potentially leading to layout issues.
The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` offers a corrected and more robust approach.
This bug can be difficult to track down because it involves subtle interactions between units and the `calc()` function's order of operations.  Understanding the correct way to combine percentages and other units within `calc()` is crucial for avoiding this type of error.
